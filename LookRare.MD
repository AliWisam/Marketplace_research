## _Introduction_ :


LooksRare is a decentralized, community-first NFT marketplace that actively rewards traders, token stakers, creators and collectors for participating on the platform. [[1]](https://docs.looksrare.org/about/welcome-to-looksrare)

Part of being community-first means that LooksRare rewards, empowers, and gives back to the platform's users and creators.

  - Get rewarded - Users that buy or sell any NFTs on LooksRare earn LOOKS tokens.
  - Share the platform fees - 100% of trading fees are earned by LOOKS stakers.
  - Creators get paid instantly - Creators get royalty payments at the moment of sale.


Two unidentified founders going by the pseudonyms “Zodd” and “Guts” launched the platform in January 2022, with a team of 11 members tending to the project’s development. The aim of LooksRare was to dethrone OpenSea from its number one spot in the NFT market. The site had planned to add new features to lure NFT enthusiasts, according to a blog post at the time. Almost all of those initiatives have focused on the incentive program built around the Looks token awarded to active users of the platform.

About $18 billion of the trading volume on the platform, or about 95% of the total activity, can be attributed to what’s often referred to as wash sales, according to data compiled by NFT tracker CryptoSlam. The transactions are seen as one of the many gray areas in crypto when it comes to regulation. In this case, the sales are done to win new tokens rather than to pump up nonfungible token prices to lure unsuspecting buyers. The marketplace benefits from the fees generated by each transaction.
