## _Introduction_ :

Larva Labs is a New York-based mobile software firm. They create apps for iOS and Android smartphones. Some of their products’ highlights include the number one paid game on Android, RetroDefense, and a picture manipulation app in the top 50 on iPhone, PhotoTwist. The CryptoPunks marketplace is on the Larva Labs website. It also has a marketplace for the team's other NFT project, Meebits.

The Larva Labs site isn't strictly an NFT market. It also showcases the company's other projects, which include blockchain art, apps, and gaming. Although Larva Labs is best known for its NFTs, its web platform is much different than what you see on other NFT marketplaces.

In March 2022, Larva Labs sold the CryptoPunks and Meebits intellectual properties to Yuga Labs, creator of the rival NFT collection Bored Apes Yacht Club. Although Yuga Labs now owns both collections, the CryptoPunks and Meebits marketplaces are still on Larva Lab's website.

Two of the most popular projects of Larva Labs besides CryptoPunks are Autoglyphs and Meebits.

# **Top Perks**

### No Service fees
Larva Labs doesn't charge any service fees on either the CryptoPunks marketplace or the Meebits marketplace when buying NFTs. Note that because the marketplaces use the Ethereum blockchain, transactions have gas fees. The gas fees on each NFT sale are charged by Ethereum and not by Larva Labs.

### Buy CryptoPunk and Meebits
The CryptoPunks are some of the most popular NFTs, and if you want to buy one, you can do so on Larva Labs. This company also offers newer types of digital collectibles called Meebits, although those haven't had as much success or recognition as CryptoPunks.


# CryptoPunks
Punks is one of the first Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens. These are algorithmically generated unique digital works of art of 24×24 pixel size. There are only 10,000 unique CryptoPunks. Most of the punks are human characters, i.e., 6039 are males and 3840 are females NFTs. Some special categories like Zombie (88), Ape (24), and Alien (9) are also present. Each of these punks has its page that contains the details about its features, owner, availability status, and transaction history.

## **Working** :

<br>
Larva Labs established its own marketplace on the CryptoPunks website in addition to developing the CryptoPunks themselves. Users may place bids, purchase, and sell CryptoPunks here. By installing and linking your MetaMask, you may engage with the marketplace. CryptoPunks have also made their way onto OpenSea, a prominent Ethereum-based NFT platform. These pixel punks, on the other hand, are a little different. They’ve been wrapped in ERC-721 tokens, making them tradeable on NFT exchanges.

Purchasing CryptoPunks is a simple process. If you understand how blockchain works, it simply takes a few steps. To learn how it works, follow the step-by-step instructions below.

Purchase Ether: Using a cryptocurrency exchange, you may convert your cash into Ether and transfer it to your wallet.
Transfer it to your wallet: MetaMask is widely used in NFT marketplaces, and CryptoPunks supports it. Create a MetaMask account.
Connect to Larva Labs: You can purchase and sell NFTs from the primary market, Larva Labs, or OpenSea.
Pick a CryptoPunk and Buy It: Take your time looking over the alternatives and then pick a punk.
 
 ## Usage Guide
To explore and to buy these punks, visit their [website](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)   .

<img width="2804" alt="All Punks" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*O9FBT81szTsmfuQr.jpg">

As we have mentioned that CryptoPunks are Ethereum-based NFTs, so to access these NFTs and platforms, users are required to connect their Ethereum (MetaMask) wallet.

Connect your [MetaMask](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/bitcoin-and-crypto-guide/metamask-tips-and-tricks-you-can-use/) wallet.

From the homepage, you can get complete details about the recent transactions, punks available for sale, wrapped punks (convert CryptoPunks into ERC721), overall stats, etc.

If you are planning to buy some punks, then scroll the CryptoPunks homepage and search for the option For Sale.

## Platform Statistics
Now let us see the overall statistics of the platform and find out how it is dominating the current NFT market.

You can check the [Dapp website](https://www.dapp.com/dapps/blockchain-marketplace?sort=4&time=2&type=NaN) that lists the users and trading volume of the NFT marketplace.

<img width="2804" alt="Trading Vol" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*q6r3PZBOG6HQYmYr.jpg">

The report shows that CryptoPunks is currently ranked at the #2 position with a monthly trading volume of $194.45 million. Though it has seen a drop of 26.37% compared to last month’s trading period.

If we look at the Ethereum NFT market size, CryptoPunks hold a significant position by occupying 69.4% of the market, along with a valuation of $54.17 million currently out of the total NFT volume of $78.02 million.

## CryptoPunks: Collectible Characters on the Ethereum Blockchain

CryptoPunks are 10,000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person as managed and verified by a contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. You can see which punks are still available along with some more general information over at https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks

This repo contains the Ethereum contract used to manage the Punks, a verifiable image of all the punks, and a unit test to verify the contract's functionality.

### Some Questions

- **How much do the punks cost?** When we first released the project, you could claim a punk by simply paying the transaction fee of around 11 cents. Now, you have to buy a punk from someone else and need to pay the market rate, which at the moment is around 0.3 ETH (~$80 USD). See http://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks for the current average price.
- **How much is a punk worth?** Like many things, they're worth whatever someone will pay. People have spent 10 ETH (around $3,000) on the the rarest types.
- **How were the punk images created?** With a generator that was programmed to generate punks with a range of features and rarity. For example, there are only 88 Zombie Punks, 24 Apes, 9 Aliens and exactly [1 Alien Punk smoking a pipe](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804).

### How to Use the CryptoPunks Contract

The easiest way is to use [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts) which has added CryptoPunks to their contract dropdown. If you prefer to use an Ethereum wallet on your computer, the main CryptoPunks contract can be found at address **0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB**. Watch this contract in your Ethereum wallet using that address and [this ABI file](/compiled/CryptoPunksMarket.abi).

Once you are watching the contract you can execute the following functions to transact punks:

- `getPunk(uint index)` to claim ownership of a punk (this is no longer useful as all 10,000 punks have been claimed).
- `transferPunk(address to, uint index)` transfer ownership of a punk to someone without requiring any payment.
- `offerPunkForSale(uint punkIndex, uint minSalePriceInWei)` offer one of your punks for sale to anyone willing to pay the minimum price specified (in Wei).
- `offerPunkForSaleToAddress(uint punkIndex, uint minSalePriceInWei, address toAddress)` offer one of your punks for some minumum price, but only to the address specified. Use this to sell a punk to a specific person.
- `enterBidForPunk(uint punkIndex)` enters a bid for the punkIndex specified. Send in the amount of your bid in the value field and we will hold that ether in escrow.
- `acceptBidForPunk(uint punkIndex, uint minPrice)` to accept a pending bid for the specified punk. You can specify a minPrice in Wei to protect yourself from someone switching the bid for a lower bid.
- `withdrawBidForPunk(uint punkIndex)` will withdraw a bid for the specified punk and send you the ether from the bid.
- `buyPunk(uint punkIndex)` buy punk at the specified index. That punk needs to be previously offered for sale, and you need to have sent at least the amount of Ether specified as the sale price for the punk.
- `withdraw()` claim all the Ether people have previously sent to buy your punks.

### Verifying the Punks are 100% Authentic and Legit CryptoPunks™

<img width="2804" alt="All Punks" src="https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/raw/master/punks.png">
This is the official and genuine image of all of the CryptoPunks that have been created. To allow verification that the punks being managed by the CryptoPunks Ethereum contract are the same as what you see in the image, we have embedded a SHA256 hash of the image file into the contract. You can generate this hash for the punks image file via a command line similar to `openssl sha -sha256 punks.png` and compare that to the embedded hash in the contract `ac39af4793119ee46bbff351d8cb6b5f23da60222126add4268e261199a2921b`.

# What could be improved
## Limited NFT options
This site only has two NFT collections available, and they're both lines of digital characters. If you want to shop for other types of NFTs, such as digital art or videos, this isn't the best NFT marketplace for you.

Also worth mentioning is that Larva Lab's NFTs tend to be expensive. CryptoPunks normally cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in Ethereum, which puts them out of most people's price range.

To be fair, Larva Labs is a software development company, and its site is home to the team's professional projects. It's not built to be a massive NFT marketplace with something for everybody. But if you came across it while searching for a CryptoPunks NFT, it's good to know what you will and won't find on the company's website.

## V1 Punks controversy

Larva Labs' reputation took a hit after an incident related to V1 Punks, the original CryptoPunks project released by the lab. This version isn't as popular as the official CryptoPunks collection that Larva Labs made after, but it has seen some success as the alternative version of such a popular project.

In January 2022, one of the Larva Labs founders sold 40 of these V1 Punks for 260 ETH (worth well over $500,000 at that time). Just weeks later, Larva Labs released a statement saying V1 Punks aren't real CryptoPunks. Then, it announced it planned to take legal action against the V1 Punks collection.

To sum it up, a Larva Labs founder made a significant sum selling V1 Punks, and the company then went after that very same NFT collection. This seriously damaged its credibility in the NFT space.

## Different design than most NFT marketplaces

Both the Larva Labs website and the CryptoPunks marketplace have much different layouts than a typical NFT marketplace. For example, the CryptoPunks marketplace includes large collages of different characters and lets you sort through them based on their types and attributes.

Because of how different it is, there's a bit of a learning curve to using the platform and finding the NFT you want. Compared to other marketplaces, it's not as beginner friendly.


## No NFT minting
Larva Labs is designed for buying and selling its own NFTs. It's not a place where you can mint NFTs of your own and list them for sale.

## Alternatives to consider

If you want to check out more NFT collections: Rarible has a massive selection of NFTs from both popular collections, like Bored Ape Yacht Club, and smaller offerings. You can find many different types of NFTs here, including digital art, videos, and characters, and there are NFTs available at every price range.

If you're interested in minting your own NFTs: Mintable has one of the fastest, most user-friendly processes for NFT minting. It also gives you the option of gasless minting, which allows you to mint an NFT without paying the typical gas fees to the blockchain network.
