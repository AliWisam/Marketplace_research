## _Introduction_ :

Crypto.com was founded in 2016 in Hong Kong. It currently offers more than 250 cryptocurrencies to over 10 million customers worldwide. Crypto.com serves users in 90 countries with a unique suite of cryptocurrency-related financial products. The long list of currencies, low pricing, and additional features make Crypto.com suitable for beginner to advanced cryptocurrency users. However, beginners may find the plethora of features intimidating. If you apply to become a creator and you’re rejected, there’s currently no way to resubmit your application. And minting a new NFT takes a minimum of 72-hours.

However, there’s no fee for minting. And except a $3 submission fee, there are no marketplace fees or gas fees to worry about. So, if you’re ok with waiting three days, that could be a good trade-off. Apart from the potential frustrations creators may run into with this platform, buyers can use multiple payment methods and a variety of wallets. Plus, you can connect a debit or credit card for NFT purchases. It’s very convenient and something that other major NFT marketplaces lack — OpenSea only accepts crypto payments.

## **How it Works** :

<br>

•	Buy NFTs minted on Crypto.org Chain, and safelisted NFTs from Ethereum, Polygon and Cronos collections. At the time of writing, there are 28 safelisted Cronos collections, 22 safelisted Polygon NFT collections and 57 safelisted ETH collections.
•	CRO is Crypto.com’s native token, and can be used to buy NFTs, but there are multiple payment methods available including credit and debit cards, as well as over 20 cryptocurrencies and many supported wallets.
•	You’re required to have a Crypto.com account to purchase and sell NFTs, and if you pay for ETH NFTs using the Crypto.com Wallet, you don’t have to pay gas fees.
•	To mint, you must apply to become a creator. With each NFT submission, there’s a $3 submission fee and a 72-hour review period for the platform to confirm the NFT meets community standards: no vulgarity, nudity, etc. NFTs minted on the platform are Crypto.org Chain NFTs.
