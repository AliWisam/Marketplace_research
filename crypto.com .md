## _Introduction_ :

 - The Crypto.com NFT app and marketplace is a division of Crypto.com – one of the best crypto exchanges on the market. Most traders will have heard of Crypto.com, as the exchange has a stellar reputation regarding fees and user-friendliness. Given the remarkable popularity of NFTs, Crypto.com decided to launch its own marketplace in March 2021, constructed on the Crypto.org chain.
 
 - The Crypto.com NFT Marketplace requires Crypto.com users to create an additional account to use it – although this only takes a matter of minutes. Once created, users can instantly verify their NFT account by linking it to their Crypto.com trading account via the app. Overall, this process is rapid and enables users to benefit from the features contained in Crypto.com’s ecosystem.

- The marketplace itself contains an array of the best NFTs to buy, from categories such as art, gaming, sports, music, and more. Each NFT will be listed for a fixed price or through a traditional auction, offering flexibility for buyers and sellers. Interestingly, Crypto.com NFTs can be purchased instantly using a credit or debit card. This is in contrast to many other NFT marketplaces that require crypto to facilitate payments.

- Ultimately, this streamlined approach to NFT trading has made the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace incredibly popular. Users can make investments through the browser-based platform or the Crypto.com NFT app, ensuring there’s an option for everyone. Finally, a recent press release from Crypto.com announced that the platform will now offer Ethereum-based NFTs – greatly expanding the potential universe of assets.

## **How it Works** :

<br>

 - Buy NFTs minted on Crypto.org Chain, and safelisted NFTs from Ethereum, Polygon and Cronos collections. At the time of writing, there are 28 safelisted Cronos collections, 22 safelisted Polygon NFT collections and 57 safelisted ETH collections.

 - CRO is Crypto.com’s native token, and can be used to buy NFTs, but there are multiple payment methods available including credit and debit cards, as well as over 20 cryptocurrencies and many supported wallets.
 
 - You’re required to have a Crypto.com account to purchase and sell NFTs, and if you pay for ETH NFTs using the Crypto.com Wallet, you don’t have to pay gas fees.
 
 - To mint, you must apply to become a creator. With each NFT submission, there’s a $3 submission fee and a 72-hour review period for the platform to confirm the NFT meets community standards: no vulgarity, nudity, etc. NFTs minted on the platform are Crypto.org Chain NFTs.

  - <br>

- **_Buyer Fee :_**

  - Buyers do not pay additional fees for making purchases. Simply select the NFT you like and pay the exact amount of the listed price. [Referance](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5074395-buying-and-selling)
  

  <br>

- **_Seller Fee :_**

  - if you are the seller, normally a 5% processing fee will be deducted from the total purchase amount to cover the operational costs of the platform. [Referance](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5074395-buying-and-selling)_
  
  <br>

- **_Royalties :_**

  - Note that royalties are fixed at 10% for resales of collectibles created directly by creators through the platform.
  
  <br>

- **_Listing Type/ Selling Methods :_**

  - Fixed Price Model 

     The seller sets a fixed price for the item. 

     The buyer purchases the item at its fixed price. 

  - Auction Model 

      The seller puts an item up for auction by inputting the end date and the minimum bid amount.

      The buyer places a bid, which has to be higher than the previous highest bid by 5% or USD 10, whichever is higher. Please note the highest bidder cannot cancel his/her bid.

      Sellers can choose to end the auction earlier by a) canceling the auction, and the current top bidder gets a refund, or b) terminating the auction early, and the current top bidder wins the bid**. When the auction ends, the current top bidder wins the bid. If it ends without any bids, the item goes back to the ‘Not for sale’ status. 

* Each edition can have a standalone auction, meaning that a collectible with 100 editions can at most have 100 auctions happening simultaneously. 

** Auctions cannot be canceled or terminated by sellers within 24 hours prior to the expiration time.

## _Contracts Description_ :

<br>

- **_Minting NFT :_**


 - Once approved as a creator, you can mint collectibles on our platform. Begin by clicking on the “Create” button on the navigation bar, and providing all the required details. You can create up to 50 collectibles per week and 10 editions for each collectible.

 - Once created, your collectible will be viewable immediately and made available for listing once minted. Note that minting time may vary depending on network usage. 

 - Once your NFTs have been minted on the blockchain they can't be removed or modified. Additionally, collectibles can only be assigned to a collection at the moment of their upload. NFTs can't be added to a collection after being minted.  
  
<br>

```javascript
    function mint_by_cronos_module(address addr, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == module_address);
        mint(addr, amount);
    }
```

<br>

- **_Buying Process :_**


 - You can purchase items that are available in primary sales (including ‘drops’) or secondary sales. Pay with a credit/debit card, your account balance, or with Crypto.com Pay - via the Crypto.com App or using a wallet that supports ERC20 tokens (e.g., Metamask, WalletConnect). If you have accumulated some account balance, you can then use it to make purchases once you have connected your Crypto.com App account (KYC required).
 
 - Please note that you must have the same email address for Crypto.com NFT and Crypto.com App. If you use different email addresses, we recommend you to change the email address on the App. You can click the gear icon located in the top left of the App homepage and then click into your profile to change your email address. 

 - If you would like to use Crypto.com Pay, please click the ‘Crypto.com Pay’ button on the payment method page to proceed to checkout. You will then see a pop-up page with various wallet options. Once you have chosen your preferred wallet, please scan a pop-up QR code and/or follow the on-screen instructions to connect your wallet and complete the payment.

  -

<br>

```javascript
function buy() {
  return "Congrats! You bought NFT for 1 ETH";
}
```


<br>

## _Conclusion_ :

- Crypto.com is a good choice for cryptocurrency traders looking for a platform with relatively low fees and an extensive list of supported currencies.

- It’s best for people who feel confident managing a financial account through a mobile app and may be ideal for those with intermediate cryptocurrency knowledge and experience.

- Like other cryptocurrency exchanges, customer service isn’t a strong suit for Crypto.com, so plan on a primarily self-service experience. If you’re comfortable with that, Crypto.com could be a suitable option for your needs.
