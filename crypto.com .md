## _Introduction_ :

Crypto.com was founded in 2016 in Hong Kong. It currently offers more than 250 cryptocurrencies to over 10 million customers worldwide. Crypto.com serves users in 90 countries with a unique suite of cryptocurrency-related financial products. The long list of currencies, low pricing, and additional features make Crypto.com suitable for beginner to advanced cryptocurrency users. However, beginners may find the plethora of features intimidating. If you apply to become a creator and you’re rejected, there’s currently no way to resubmit your application. And minting a new NFT takes a minimum of 72-hours.

However, there’s no fee for minting. And except a $3 submission fee, there are no marketplace fees or gas fees to worry about. So, if you’re ok with waiting three days, that could be a good trade-off. Apart from the potential frustrations creators may run into with this platform, buyers can use multiple payment methods and a variety of wallets. Plus, you can connect a debit or credit card for NFT purchases. It’s very convenient and something that other major NFT marketplaces lack — OpenSea only accepts crypto payments.

## **How it Works** :

<br>

•	Buy NFTs minted on Crypto.org Chain, and safelisted NFTs from Ethereum, Polygon and Cronos collections. At the time of writing, there are 28 safelisted Cronos collections, 22 safelisted Polygon NFT collections and 57 safelisted ETH collections.
•	CRO is Crypto.com’s native token, and can be used to buy NFTs, but there are multiple payment methods available including credit and debit cards, as well as over 20 cryptocurrencies and many supported wallets.
•	You’re required to have a Crypto.com account to purchase and sell NFTs, and if you pay for ETH NFTs using the Crypto.com Wallet, you don’t have to pay gas fees.
•	To mint, you must apply to become a creator. With each NFT submission, there’s a $3 submission fee and a 72-hour review period for the platform to confirm the NFT meets community standards: no vulgarity, nudity, etc. NFTs minted on the platform are Crypto.org Chain NFTs.

  -

  <br>

- **_Seller Fee :_**

  - if you are the seller, normally a 5% processing fee will be deducted from the total purchase amount to cover the operational costs of the platform. [Referance](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5074395-buying-and-selling)_
  - <br>

- **_Royalties :_**

  - Note that royalties are fixed at 10% for resales of collectibles created directly by creators through the platform.
  - <br>

- **_Listing Type/ Selling Methods :_**

  - Fixed Price Model 

The seller sets a fixed price for the item. 

The buyer purchases the item at its fixed price. 

  - Auction Model 

1. The seller puts an item up for auction by inputting the end date and the minimum bid amount.

2. The buyer places a bid, which has to be higher than the previous highest bid by 5% or USD 10, whichever is higher. Please note the highest bidder cannot cancel his/her bid.

3. Sellers can choose to end the auction earlier by a) canceling the auction, and the current top bidder gets a refund, or b) terminating the auction early, and the current top bidder wins the bid**. When the auction ends, the current top bidder wins the bid. If it ends without any bids, the item goes back to the ‘Not for sale’ status. 

* Each edition can have a standalone auction, meaning that a collectible with 100 editions can at most have 100 auctions happening simultaneously. 

** Auctions cannot be canceled or terminated by sellers within 24 hours prior to the expiration time.
