## _Introduction_ :

Atomic Assets is developed by Pink Network — a group of blockchain enthusiasts active on the WAX and Proton blockchain. AtomicAssets is powered by the Eosio blockchain technology and Atomic Hub Marketplace is the platform to buy and sell NFTs. The portal is available to anyone for tokenizing and creating digital assets and to buy, sell or auction digital assets.AtomicHub is split into an Explorer that lets you browse through all the AtomicAssets NFTs, a Marketplace where you can buy and sell your NFTs, a Trading section, and perhaps most excitingly a NFT Creator. The NFT Creator allows anyone to create their own NFTs without any required coding knowledge.

Atomic Assets was first launched in February 2020 and the Atomic Hub Marketplace for NFTs was launched in June 2020. At the date of 30 March 2021, Atomic Hub claims that over 9.2 million NFTs have been created on the WAX Blockchain on the platform.

## **Working Details** :

<br>
Atomic Hub marketplace allows any uniquely created and original artworks to be listed on its platform. At the time of whitelisting, the portal seeks proof of originality from the artist. Proof of originality may include detailed descriptions of how the artwork was created or raw files.
<br>

## Atomic Hub Marketplace Fees
When you make a trade at Atomic Hub marketplace, they charge you with a commission. The commission is normally a percentage of the sale amount in the relevant trade.

Atomic Hub Marketplace charges 2.00% of the total sales price as platform commission, automatically deducted by smart contracts at the time of sale. Additional fees like royalty or blockchain fees may also be applicable. However, this will be deducted directly from the sales price instead of being levied as an additional charge to the sales price.

## Layout of Atomic Hub Marketplace
Different NFT Marketplaces present their NFTs, the latest bid and the remaining time of an auction etc. in different ways. What you are most comfortable with viewing and using is up to you and no one else. The following picture is a print screen from Atomic Hub Marketplace showing a specific NFT.

Each artwork has a unique ID. The artist has to define multiple parameters like the Asset name, Collection name and Schema name. The artist also has to include the properties of the asset — like transferability or the option to burn the asset.

The portal also lists the pricing history of the asset, based on the template ID. To make the interface more buyer-friendly, the portal also lists the recent transfer history and other suggested artworks that could interest the buyer.

## Atomic Hub Marketplace Payment Methods

A few of the NFT Marketplaces out there accept deposits and payments via credit or debit card, and some even accept PayPal-deposits.

Atomic Hub Marketplace does not support Credit Cards or PayPal. WAX tokens will be the only supported tokens, as far as we know. The portal has a functionality that allows new tokens to be added over time. However, these new token additions will be determined as and when the demand arises. Alternatively, users can price their assets in USD. But at the time of settlement, they would be paid by WAX tokens, converted at the prevailing rates.

<br>

## **A Trading Interface**

The trading interface allows you to see the trade offers that you received and the ones that you sent, and it of course also allows you to create new trade offers. You are also able to transfer NFTs directly if you don’t want anything in return.

An additional exciting feature are “Shared Links”. You are able to select which NFTs you want to include, and then a link is generated. Anyone opening this link will then be able to claim the NFTs. This means you could for example easily share an NFT with a person without having to know their blockchain account, possibly even with someone who doesn’t even have a blockchain account yet and is then incentivized to create one.
## **An NFT Creator**

Using the NFT Creator, anyone is able to create their own collections and mint their own NFTs, without requiring any programming knowledge.

    The first step is to create a Collection. Collections are like a group for NFTs that are of a similar theme, e.g. that belong to the same Dapp.
    For example, Garbage Pail Kids could be a collection
    The second step is creating a Schema. Schemas belong to a specific collection, and a collection can have multiple schemas. They define which kind of attributes the assets will have (in tech terms: the data structure).
    In the GPK example, Series 1 could be a schema, and the attributes could be Name, Image, ID, Variant, Rarity and Mint Number.
    The third step is optional, but can be very useful. It’s creating a Template, which belongs to a certain schema. Once again, a schema can have multiple templates.
    Think of a template as a set of predefined attributes. Assets can later reference a template and then have the attribute values that were set in the template automatically. Templates can also have a maximum supply, which can give NFTs provable scarcity.
    In the GPK example, you could create one template for every variation of the cards. On template could for example define the values:
    - Name: “Fryin’ Brian”
    - Image: A certain IPFS Hash
    - ID: 4
    - Variant: “A”
    - Rarity: “Golden”
    and set a maximum supply of 25.
    The final step is creating the asset (NFT). Assets also belong to a certain collection. When creating the asset, you set the values of the attributes that were previously defined in the schema.
    As mentioned before, assets can also reference a template, in which case the values defined in the template are automatically applied to the asset.
    In the GPK example, you could create 25 assets which all reference the “Fryin’ Brian” template. You would then only have to set the value of the Mint Number attribute, as all the other attributes are already set in the template.

Admittedly, going through those steps for the first time is not super user friendly. However, we believe that the benefits of this more refined structure far outweigh the additional 5 minutes or so that it takes before you can create your first NFT. Also keep in mind that collections and schemas only have to be created once and can then be used over and over again in the future.

Nevertheless, we already have plans to further simplify the process and we will put a lot of effort into making this process as easy to understand as possible.

## Wallets
## Anchor Wallet
Use the Anchor Wallet to seamlessly and securely interact with any EOSIO-based blockchain. Anchor is a security and privacy focused open-source digital wallet for all EOSIO-based networks. Anchor uses modern approaches to ensure the security of your accounts. The use of strong encryption. A core principle considered in the design of Anchor is the need for privacy when using it.

## Scatter Wallet
Scatter Desktop is an open-source wallet for your digital currencies and assets. With the completion of months of work integrating our new Walletpack library, Scatter Desktop is better than ever. The built-in application explorer will help you discover new and exciting experiences possible only on the blockchain.

## WAX
The Worldwide Asset eXchange™ (WAX) is the world’s leading decentralized video game and entertainment network. We deliver the safest and most convenient way to create, buy, sell, and trade virtual items (NFTs) - to anyone, anywhere in the world. The WAX tokenomic model marries the explosive growth of NFTs with the superior monetization capabilities of DeFi.

# From a developer’s perspective

Happy developers are the first step for happy users. That’s why our focus when designing the AtomicAssets standard has always been to make it as powerful and versatile as possible, but without adding unnecessary complexity to deal with. But we haven’t just been working on the standard itself, we have also put a lot of work into the ecosystem surrounding it.

## Notifications for Smart Contracts

Collections can specify notify accounts, which will receive on-chain inline notifications about relevant actions like transfers or burns. This allows Dapps to keep track of assets in their own smart contracts and thus make them a fully integrated part of their smart contract logic.



## A powerful API

We have developed a powerful API for AtomicAssets and the AtomicMarket, which makes getting the data you need very easy. It is open source (Click here), which means that you can run it on your own servers, or you can just use the endpoints provided by us (WAX AtomicAssets, WAX AtomicMarket).
## The AtomicMarket smart contract

The AtomicMarket smart contract, which is also used by the AtomicHub, is designed to have a decentralized fee structure. This means that there isn’t a single account that receives all the fees, but instead for every sale (or auction) the marketplaces facilitating the listing and the marketplace facilitating the purchase each get a 1% fee.

Because marketplaces still get the full marketplace fee when using the AtomicMarket smart contract, it makes sense to use it and thus tap into the shared liquidity pool. Shared liquidity is good for marketplaces, which are able to display more interesting sales to their users, and it is good for the users, whose sales will be displayed to more potential buyers.




# AtomicAssets
AtomicAssets is a Non Fungible Token (NFT) standard for eosio blockchains developed by [pink.network](https://pink.network).

It offers a powerful feature set while keeping unnecessary complexity to a minimum and focusses on RAM efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Powerful structure**

	NFTs are grouped by collections rather than their author, which allows for flexible authorizations. \
	Schemas give NFTs an extensible data structure, which is used for the serialization. \
	Templates store data and can be referenced by assets. This allows grouping similar assets together and saving RAM by not having to store the same data for each asset individually. Templates can also make NFTs non-transferable or non-burnable. \
	Assets always belong to a collection and a schema, and can optionally reference a template.
	
- **Data Serialization**

	AtomicAssets uses a custom built serialization inspired by Protobuf, which significantly reduces RAM costs compared to traditional methods (e.g. JSON strings). Serialization is done within the contract, which guarantees that no corrupt data enters the blockchain state.
	
- **No RAM Costs for users**

	The RAM cost is paid fully by the dapps that create the assets. Even when transfering assets, this stays the same. The maximum an end user will ever have to pay are 112 bytes for their own scope, and even that will likely only rarely be necessary.
	This also means that AtomicAssets works **without claims**. Transfers are instant and no further user action is required.
	
- **Minimal fixed RAM costs**

	Creating an asset only costs **151 bytes** (112 of which are for the necessary index). Additionally, each token owner needs to have a scope, which costs **112 bytes**. 
	
- **Notifications for Smart Contracts**

	Smart Contracts can get notified automatically about any relevant events related to their assets. This enables them to make the assets an integral part of their game rather than just a static token.
	
- **Backing assets with Fungible Tokens**

	Assets can be backed by standard fungible tokens (e.g. EOS / WAX). Those tokens can only be freed by burning the asset, thus allowing dapps to give their asset a guaranteed intrinsic value.
	
- **Powerful Trade Offers**

	AtomicAssets features a native implementation of two sided trade offers (similar to Steam or WAX Express Trade). This allows creating and accepting offers **with a single action**.
	The implementation of the offers also allows for **peer to peer marketplaces** that don't require transferring ownership to a market contract.
